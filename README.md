# Beacons Cordova/PhoneGap plugin

## This Plugin is an extension from: [phonegap-estimotebeacons](https://github.com/evothings/phonegap-estimotebeacons)

---

Plugin forked from Evothings repository to extend its functionalities in order to leverage the following additional features:

* Region monitoring while application is closed
* Local notification if the application is closed and webview-wide DOM event when application is running.
* A region can be registered with associated notification data and deeplink URL.
* When the application is opened from a notification, the notification data can be delivered as a deeplink or in the WebView;
* Turning on the bluetooth will start monitoring for regions. Likewise, turning the bluetooth off will shut the monitoring off. (Android)
